== README

A Rails application I wrote for my Industrial Software Development course.
The basic structure is a registration app where users can register for courses online. Each course has multiple offerings, and these offerings can be searched for by various criteria.
The user interface is very basic and "enrolling" in a course only decrements the number of openings available - in a full app, this would include checks to make sure you can only enroll in a course once, no schedule conflicts, credits, etc.
